				<h3>Unique Ecosystem</h3>
				<p>The geothermal areas of Greenstone include several geyser basins known as chromatic lakes. The number of chromatic lakes  in Greenstone is estimated at 56 These are distributed among nine separate locations.</p>
				<p>The colours of the chromatic lakes vary from lake to lake and region to region. The lakes in the north of the park are predominantly shades of red and blue. While the lakes in the south-east of the park are predominantly yellow, red and orange.</p>
				<p>It is not the water itself that is colored. Rather it is the <a href="#">mineral deposits</a> from the thermal vents below the lakes that hold the color. More specifically, it is the bacteria that attach themselves to these deposits that produce the colors. <span class="text-danger font-weight-bold">The water itself is toxic for humans and for most animals</span>. Only certain species of bird are able to live near to the lakes, and even they do not drink the water.</p>
				<p>The <a href="#">hydrothermal system</a> that supplies the lakes with hot water sits within an ancient active <a href="#">volcanic caldera</a>. Volcanic activity is constantly changing the size and shape of the lakes. In some cases, after mild volcanic activity entire lakes disappear, or new lakes are formed.</p> 
				<p>Prehistoric Native American artefacts have been found at <a href="#">Mammoth Lake</a> and other geothermal areas in Greenstone. Some accounts state that the early people used hot water from the geothermal features for bathing and cooking. The lakes were also treated as scared spiritual sites that held special significance. Local native tribes seldom dared to enter the lake area because of frequent loud noises that sounded like thunder and the belief that the spirits that possessed the area did not like human intrusion into their realm.</p>
